# wndchrm nightly build / smoke test script
# by Chris Coletta

# This script is kicked off by cron on behalf of the user tester@iicbu2 at midnight.
# You can edit the cron settings by logging into iicbu2 as "tester" and typing `crontab -e`
# (make sure you have exported the environment variable 'EDITOR=vi' or emacs or nano etc.)

# This script looks for a file called /home/tester/build_control_flags/kick_me_for_wndchrm_build.
# If it doesn't exist, it is created, and a build/test sequence begins.
# If is does exist, the modification date on the file is compared to the modification date 
# of the file ~/build_control_flags/last_wndchrm_build_completed. If the "kick me" flag has been 
# modified more recently than the "last build completed flag" the build/test sequence is initiated.
# Otherwise, this script exits.

# the 'kick_me_for_wndchrm_build' can be
